# Easy-LC3-Editor
## Description
The Easy LC 3 Editor was created by Hayden Carroll and Austin Kuglers as a final project for CS-155 at North Idaho College.

## Getting Started
This Project requires Python 3 to be installed and added to PATH.
1. [Download the latest version of Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/)
2. During installation ensure the checkbox for adding Python to PATH is selected.
3. Type `python` in the Windows command prompt to ensure it is properly installed.

## Installing Easy LC3 Editor
1. Click the "Clone or download" button to download the repository.
2. Select Download ZIP
3. Save and extract the ZIP file
4. Open Windows command prompt and use `cd C:\Easy-LC3-Editor` to make the current directory the Easy-LC3-Editor folder. Note: you will need to replace the "C:\Easy-LC3-Editor" portion of the command to the location where you extracted the ZIP file.
5. Run the Easy LC-3 Editor using the command `python EasyLC3Editor.py`
6. Read the user guide once the application has been launched by pressing Help > User Guide.
7. **Do not** close the Windows command prompt tab. This is where the LC-3 interpreter performs input and output. We suggest placing it directly below the Editor.
